<span class="blacktextgrey16"><strong>What makes us different:</strong></span>
<span class="blacktextgrey14"><br /><br />
	
<strong>1) Personalized, helpful, and accurate health answers.</strong>  Every question on TalkAboutHealth should be the best resource possible, covering all points of view and perspectives.  To accomplish this goal, we find and notify the right people to answer questions. Then the community curates, edits, and organizes questions and answers to make them easy to find and accessible to everyone.<br /><br />

<strong>2) The right information to the right people, at the right time.</strong>  We match answers and information to the people who need them, based on their disease, stage, treatments, side effects, and more.  We notify members in real time of answers to their questions and other relevant information via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, IM, and more.  <br /><br />

<strong>3) Connect the right people to support each other.</strong>  We match patients and caregivers with experienced peers, survivors, and experts who can help.  Members are matched based on their self-reported disease, stage, treatments, cultural background, demographics, and more. <br /><br />
