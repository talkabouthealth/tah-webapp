<span class="blacktextgrey16"><strong>What makes us different:</strong></span>
<span class="blacktextgrey14"><br /><br />
	
<strong>1) Relevant, helpful, and accurate health answers and information.</strong>  Every question on TalkAboutHealth should be the best resource possible, covering all points of view and perspectives.  To accomplish this goal, we find and notify the right experts and trained survivors to answer questions.  Answers come directly from experts performing the research and caring for patients every day in surgery, oncology, psychiatry, screening, prevention, and more.  We then curate and organize the content and answers to make them easy to find and accessible to everyone.<br /><br />

<strong>2) The right information to the right people, at the right time.</strong>  We organize and curate all of our content so answers are easy to find, and we guide patients to relevant information based on their disease, stage, treatments, side effects, and more.  We notify users of answers to their questions and other relevant information via e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter.  <br /><br />

<strong>3) Connect the right people to support each other.</strong>  We match patients and caregivers with experienced peers, survivors, and experts who can help.  Members are matched based on their disease, stage, treatments, cultural background, demographics, and more. <br /><br />

<span class="blacktextgrey16"><strong>Message from our founder: Murray Jones</strong></span>
<span class="blacktextgrey14"><br /><br /><div style="width:120px;float:left"><img src="/public/images/murrayTAH.JPG" alt="" width="110"/></div>
I was inspired to start TalkAboutHealth while my father was going through treatment for melanoma.  It was a difficult and emotional period where we had many decisions to make in a limited amount of time.  We felt alone and confused.  There was too much information available and we did not know what was relevant or significant.<br/><br/>
There are 12 million survivors in the United States and 1.6 million new cases in 2012.  All of these patients need support and education.  That is why TalkAboutHealth is here.  Our goal is to improve outcomes by helping patients find the right information, communicate better with their doctors expressing their needs and desires, and feel confident in their decisions.  <br/><br/>
