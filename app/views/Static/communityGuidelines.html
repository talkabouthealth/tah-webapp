</span>
<span class="bluetext16"><strong>Question Guidelines</strong></span><br /><br />
<span class="blacktext14"><strong>Questions should ...</strong></span><br />
<span class="blacktextgrey14">
- be clear and precise providing context and background information when appropriate.<br />
- use standard english and complete sentences with correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation to make content accessible and understandable for everyone.<br />
- be general, not specific to a particular user.<br />
- have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.<br />
- seek narrative answers and are sufficiently open ended.<br />
- inspire peers to share experiences rather than asking for opinions.<br />
- insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.<br />
- invite answers that explain “why” and “how”.<br /><br />
</span>
<span class="blacktext14"><strong>Questions should not ...</strong></span><br />
<span class="blacktextgrey14">
- request answers that are all equally valid (i.e. "What's your favorite X?"). Ask why or give the reason for your question.<br />
- be answers, statements, or opinions.  Use “Thoughts” for these.<br />
- be duplicated. Before asking a question, make sure it has not already been asked.<br /><br />
</span>

<a name="answer"></a>		
<div id="dashedborder" style="width:590px;"></div><br />
</span>
<span class="bluetext16"><strong>Answer Guidelines</strong><br /><br /></span>
<span class="blacktext14"><strong>Answers should ...</strong></span><br />
<span class="blacktextgrey14">
- be based on personal experiences or research that can be backed up with a reference.  Share what you have done, rather than what you think. "I heard it somewhere" is not valid.<br />
- be courteous, respectful, and open minded, there is usually no "right" answer. There can be opposing theories and strategies that are appropriate for different people. It is okay to disagree as long as both sides are providing their own facts (references to other sources and personal experiences).<br />
- directly respond to the question.<br />
- be honest and authentic while presenting a point of view accurately and in context.  Not presenting any point of view as "the truth" or "the best view".<br />
- cite verifiable, authoritative sources, especially on controversial topics. <br /><br />
</span>
<span class="blacktext14"><strong>Answers should not ...</strong></span><br />
<span class="blacktextgrey14">
- tell someone what to do or recommend personal medical advice.<br />
- be inaccurate, unhelpful, or misleading.<br />
- be based completely on an opinion.<br />
- be excessively self-promoting. If you happen to have written a blog post that directly answers a question, it's okay to link to that, but please post a summary in your answer.<br />
- promote a product or business if you're directly involved in it, unless someone asked a question specifically about it.<br />
- Astroturfing is specifically prohibited.<br /><br />

<a name="topic"></a>		
<div id="dashedborder" style="width:590px;"></div><br /></span>
<span class="bluetext16"><strong>Topic Guidelines</strong><br /><br /></span>
<span class="blacktextgrey14">
- Accurate and directly relevant topics should be associated with a question.  This includes relevant to the question details, broad parent topics, more specific topics, and topics that are relevant to the subject matter of the question but not explicitly mentioned.<br />
- Currently topics may be created and questions may be assigned to topics by anyone in the community with the intention of improving organizational structure.  In the future, a reputation system will be developed to provide more structure to who may organize content.  <br />
- Topic names should be capitalized the same way a title would. Always capitalize the first and last word of a topic name, and capitalize all other words except for articles, conjunctions, and prepositions less than five letters.<br />
- Nouns are preferred as topic names, rather than verbs, adjectives or questions.<br />
- The plural form of the noun should normally be used.<br />
- If there is controversy over a topic's name, Wikipedia's conventions can usually be used as an example.<br /><br />
